# NumPy Library

## Overview

This repository contains my comprehensive review and practice of the NumPy library. 
NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Contents

- NumPy Basics: Introduction to arrays, array indexing, slicing, and basic operations.
- Array Manipulations : Reshaping, joining, splitting, and broadcasting arrays.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and NumPy installed. You can install NumPy using pip if you haven't already:

bash
pip install numpy
